## Hi there 👋

My name is Adrian Peña, and I am a graduate student pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science. Alongside my studies, I work as a teaching assistant (TA) and research assistant. My background spans from applied AI security to my current interests in Human–AI Interaction (HAI) and ethics in technology.

🔬 **Research Interests**
* **Federated Learning & AI Security**: Worked on anomaly detection and robustness in federated systems, including a **PID controller for convergence stability** and adversarial/anomalous client detection using the **Flower framework (flwr)**.
* **Human–AI Interaction (HAI)**: Currently exploring how humans build **trust in AI systems**, with a focus on ethics, interpretability, explainable AI (XAI),  and the role of AI in decision-making.
* **Ethics & Future of AI**: Asking the hard questions about **how AI integrates into society**, where it should be trusted, and how humans and machines can work together responsibly.

🛠️ **Technical Skills**
* **Languages**: Python (primary), Java, C++, C, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL
* **Frameworks & Libraries**: Flower, PyTorch, React
* **Tools**: Git, Linux CLI, Jupyter, Optuna, LaTeX

📚 **Projects**
* **PID-Enhanced FL Aggregation**: Implemented a PID controller in federated averaging to improve convergence under heterogeneous and adversarial conditions.
* **Anomaly Detection in Federated Learning**: Researched detection methods for anomalous/malicious clients in decentralized training setups.
* **Spotify Scheduler** (Undergrad Capstone): Built a DJ-like system with the **Spotify API** and **React**, enabling real-time collaborative playlist scheduling.

🎯 **Current Goals**
* Advance research in **trust, usability, and ethics in AI/HAI**.
* Build hands-on experience with **HCI/UX frameworks**, trust measurement methods, and design for explainability.
* Contribute to conversations and research on **the societal role of AI** and how humans make sense of algorithmic systems.
