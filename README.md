## Hi there 👋  

My name is **Adrian Peña**, and I am a **graduate student at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley** pursuing a **Master’s in Computer Science**. I currently serve as both a **Graduate Research Assistant** and **Teaching Assistant**, working at the intersection of **Human–AI Interaction (HAI)**, **AI ethics**, and **federated learning security**.  

---

### 🔬 Research Interests  
- **Human–AI Interaction & Ethics** – Designing and running controlled experiments to study how **AI disclosure, authorship, and transparency** shape user trust, authenticity, and perceived effort.  
- **Federated Learning & AI Robustness** – Developed a **PID-based aggregation controller** and **adversarial defense system** in federated learning to improve model stability, accuracy, and anomaly detection.  
- **Usability & Experimental Design** – Conducting mixed-method studies (Likert scales, think-aloud protocols, behavioral logging) to inform user-centered, ethical AI system design.  

---

### 🛠️ Technical Skills  
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/CSS  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** PyTorch, Flower, React, Node.js, Firebase, GitHub, Linux, Figma  
- **Research & Design:** User-Centered Design, Experimental Design, Usability Testing, AI Transparency  

---

### 📚 Highlighted Projects  
- **HAI Disclosure Experiment** – Designing and implementing a web-based experimental platform (18 conditions) to evaluate how **AI vs human authorship cues** affect user trust and decision-making.  
- **Arte Virtual Gallery (VR Usability Study)** – Led a qualitative **think-aloud user study** in VR, diagnosing key navigation pain points and proposing **ethical, AI-driven design recommendations** aligned with Microsoft HAX guidelines.  
- **PID Control for Federated Learning** – Engineered a **Python-based FL system** using the **Flower framework** and **PyTorch**, achieving improved convergence and robustness against adversarial clients.  
- **Spotify Scheduler (Capstone Project)** – Developed a **React web app** integrated with the **Spotify API** to automate collaborative playlist scheduling and management.  

---

### 🎯 Current Goals  
- Advance research on **trust, usability, and ethics in AI/HAI**.  
- Expand into **UX and experimental design frameworks** for evaluating explainable AI (XAI).  
- Collaborate on **interdisciplinary projects** connecting **AI security, human behavior, and responsible design**.
